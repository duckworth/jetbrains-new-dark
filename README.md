## Features

- JetBrains Dark color scheme: The extension utilizes the exact color scheme used in JetBrains Dark theme, creating a seamless transition for users familiar with JetBrains IDEs.
- Syntax highlighting: While the extension follows JetBrains' syntax highlighting for HTML and CSS, it retains the default modern VSCode syntax highlighting for other languages. This approach combines the benefits of the JetBrains color scheme with the powerful syntax highlighting capabilities of VSCode.
- Best of both worlds: By adopting this theme, you get the advantage of the JetBrains color scheme while still enjoying the robust syntax highlighting that VSCode offers. This ensures a visually pleasing and productive coding experience.
