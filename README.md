# JetBrains New Dark Alt
A theme for Visual Studio Code that closely resembles the new JetBrains Dark theme. The color scheme used in this theme is identical to the one used by JetBrains, ensuring a consistent and familiar look for developers who are accustomed to working with JetBrains IDEs with additional colors and tweaks for Ruby.

**Optional:** For the best experience, consider using the [Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) font.
